## Tech Stack
In this meeting, we decided on using the MERN stack. We will have an MVC architecture where the Model is MongoDB, the View is our React webapp, and the Controller is an expressJS REST API.

## Scope of Project
The end goal is to create an MVP to test product-market fit so that SPORTCRED can have a functional prototype.
Because it is a functional prototype to test product-market fit, there may be data that is mocked (NBA season data), so that development can proceed at a timely fashion and costs are minimized.

The app will also exclusively be a webapp but we recognize the need for a mobile app down the line.

## Release Goals
At the end of our sprints, we want to have released a webapp that allows users to debate(TODO-24, TODO-25), take part in trivia (TODO-18, TODO-19), share updates in open court (TODO-22, TODO-23), and make picks and predictions (TODO-20, TODO-21) so that they can strive for a higher ACS score.

We plan to finish all our user stories with a heavy emphasis on creating a fully functional debate, open court, and picks and predictions section. We want to minimize bugs and create a great user experience so that the webapp fosters fruitful discussion about basketball.
