# Sprint Planning

## Particpants

Sendooran Sitsabesan
Tony Attalla
Roozbeh Yadollahi
Antony Tang
Siavash Yassemi

## Meeting Topics / Prioritization
We prioritized the signup page, login page, ACS score infrastructure, navigation bar, and homepage user stories. The rationale behind these choices is because these user stories not only set up critical infrastructure our future user stories rely on, but these features are easy to demo and allows us to show a high level overview of the direction of our design so that the product owner can accept or reject features or suggest changes.


## Sprint Goal
We want to have most of our infrastructure (MongoDB, basic pages, and expressJS REST API) set up by the end of the sprint.
We will complete the following user stories and meet their respective criterion of satisfaction.
TODO-10 Signup / Register Page
TODO-11 Login Page
TODO-14 ACS Score Infrastructure
TODO-17 Navigation Bar
TODO-16 Homepage

## Spikes
No spikes currently. We have estimated all our user stories for this sprint :)

## Team Capacity
As 7 team members, we are taking on a total of 5 user stories that have a total of 19 ideal days worth of work.
That's about 2.7 ideal days worth of work per person. Given that many of the team have 5 courses and many have not worked with React, Express, and/or Mongo, this seams like a very reasonable goal.

User stories are split up as follows:
TODO-10 Signup / Register Page - Daniel / Kazim (7)
TODO-11 Login Page - Daniel / Kazim / Roozbeh (4)
TODO-14 ACS Score Infrastructure - Kazim / Siavash / Tony (4)
TODO-17 Navigation Bar - Daniel (2)
TODO-16 Homepage - Antony / Sendooran (2)

Systems Design task split:
CRC Cards (Backend) - Daniel
CRC Cards (Frontend) - Kazim
Software Architecture Diagram - Daniel

Many tasks are going to be completed through some pair programming as a few members already have experience with MERN and this will allow us to get everyone up to speed by the end of sprint 1.
