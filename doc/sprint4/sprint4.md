## Meeting Topics / Prioritization

We are prioritizing the final few core features this sprint and then dedicating time to housekeeping tasks like bug squashing and UI/UX improvements

## Sprint Goal

We want to clear out the entire backlog and we also want to clean up our code and squash bugs.
We will have an MVP done by the end of this sprint with all the core features requested by the product owners compelete.

## Spikes

No spikes

## Team Capacity

As 7 team members, we are taking on a total of 5 user stories that have a total of 25 story points = 25 ideal days worth of work.
That's about 3.6 ideal days worth of work per person. Our last sprint had 23 story points and we managed to finish our features even with ongoing midterms so this sprint without midterms should be reasonable.

User stories are split up as follows:

TODO-19 Head-to-Head Trivia - Daniel (7)

TODO-64 Clickable User Profiles - Antony (5)

TODO-66 UI/UX and Styling - Tony / Siavash (5)

TODO-76 ACS Tier Revamp - Kazim (4)

TODO-77 Bug Squashing - Sendooran / Roozbeh (4)
