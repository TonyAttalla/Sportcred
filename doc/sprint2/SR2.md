# Unfinished Stories / Tasks

TODO-21 - Playoff Bracket Predictions:

We only managed to complete half the story this sprint. Specifically we set up fully functional endpoints and worked out the system design, but the front end is missing.

Unfortunately we seemed to have underestimated how much work the Picks/Predictions and Playoff brackets was going to be in total and also overestimated our ability to learn state management (redux).

# Demo Feedback

The product owners asked us to make the ACS score display on every single page of SPORTCRED. The product owners suggested we should put the ACS in the SPORTCRED logo section of the navbar.

We should also make the ACS score more prominent on the "My Profile" page.

The product owners also brought up a good point about changing age to birthday. This way we can calculate the user's age based on their birthday at any time.

Our scrum master (Jerry) suggested that we have asterisks next to the required fields on the signup page.

For future features, we plan to do user profiles that others can visit and the product owners suggested that we add privacy settings for fields since the bio info for a user is meant for analytics only.

# Practices We Should / Shouldn't Continue and New Practices

We should continue our git flow because we seem to have gotten over the learning curve for git. It helped us stay up to date and allowed us to quickly resolve merge conflicts across branches.

We should continue our weekly Saturday meetings because it gave us a chance to catch up with each other's progress and bring up concerns. It also helped our own timelines to make sure we weren't blocking others.

A practice we discontinued was 2 approvals per code review. We changed our minimum approval amount to 1 to get code in to master faster. We also noticed the first reviewer always gave a very thorough code review so the second reviewer's review was usually nitpick comments which was not as helpful when nearing the end of the sprint.

For larger PRs, we leave it up to the PR creator's discretion and recommend everyone to wait for 2 reviews.

We are also planning to completely phase out pair programming as everyone gets up to speed and instead we can just reach out when we need help.

# Best / Worst Experience in Sprint 2

The learning curve was still quite steep for sprint 2 and pairing this with our other academic responsibilities caused a huge time crunch near the end of our sprint. This was by far the hardest part of sprint 2.

From our clean codebase in sprint 1, we were able to repurpose previous components for new components that had simimlar functionality. We experienced a lot of code reuse which was great for productivity.

It was also very rewarding to have improved and learned so much in 2 weeks as well as see our work turn into a functioning product. It was also nice to gain confidence in React which is framework that is widely used.
