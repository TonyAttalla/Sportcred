## Meeting Topics / Prioritization

We prioritized the signup page, login page, ACS score infrastructure, navigation bar, and homepage user stories. The rationale behind these choices is because these user stories not only set up critical infrastructure our future user stories rely on, but these features are easy to demo and allows us to show a high level overview of the direction of our design so that the product owner can accept or reject features or suggest changes.

## Sprint Goal

We want to have most of our infrastructure (MongoDB, basic pages, and expressJS REST API) set up by the end of the sprint.
We will complete the following user stories and meet their respective criterion of satisfaction.

**TODO-22 Open Court Page Posts**

- As a user I want to be able to make a post about basketball on the open court page so that I can start a conversation about a basketball topic

1. Given that I’m a user and I go to the open court page, when I make a post then I can include an image
2. Given that I’m a user and I go to the open court page, when I have submitted a post, then I can see at the top of open court
3. Given that I’m a user and I go to the open court page, when I have submitted a post and my post is liked, I gain ACS

**TODO-20 Season Picks and Predictions**

- As a user I want to be able to make picks and predictions on daily games and end of season rewards to raise my ACS score.

1. Given that I am a user when I enter the picks and predictions area of the application then I should be able to view games today and in the future and make my picks and predictions
2. Given that I have made some picks when I re-enter the app after the games have completed then I should be rewarded or decremented points from my ACS score

**TODO-21 Playoff Bracket Predictions**

- As a user I want to be able to make playoff brackets in order to raise my ACS score

1. Given that I am a user when I enter the picks and predictions area of the application then I should be able to make playoff brackets before the beginning of the playoff period
2. Given that I have made my playoff bracket when I enter the app then I should be rewarded or decremented points from my ACS based on how close my bracket was to what had happened in the playoff

**TODO-23 Open Court Page Browsing**

- As a user I want to be able to see a curated list of posts on the open court page so that I can participate in conversations on sportsCred

1. Given that I’m a user and I go to the open court page, when I see any post in the feed, then I have the option to add a comment to it
2. Given that I’m a user and I go to the open court page, when I am looking at the comments of any post, I want to see the ACS scores next to the usernames

**TODO-12 Profile and About**

- As a user I want to be able to upload and change my profile picture so that others on SPORTCRED can see it and associate it with my name.

1. Given that a user is viewing their own profile and has never uploaded a profile picture or wants to change their current profile picture, a user can change the profile picture associated with their profile using a photo from their PC
2. Given that a user is viewing their own profile, when they want to change their demographic information, they can modify the fields so that a user can change the demographic information (favorite sport, age, etc) associated with their profile
3. Given that a user is viewing their own profile, a user can type a bio section that is limited to 300 characters
4. Given that a user has completed writing their about section or modifying their demographic information, when clicking “save” then the user is taken to their profile where they are able to view their about section under their profile picture

## Spikes

No spikes currently. We have estimated all our user stories for this sprint :)

## Team Capacity

As 7 team members, we are taking on a total of 5 user stories that have a total of 26 story points = 26 ideal days worth of work.
That's about 3.7 ideal days worth of work per person. Now that the team is more familiar with the tech stack this is ambitious but doable.

User stories are split up as follows:
TODO-22 Open Court Page Posts - Daniel / Kazim
TODO-20 Season Picks and Predictions - Sendoo / Anthony
TODO-21 Playoff Bracket Predictions - Siavash / Roozbeh
TODO-23 Open Court Page Browsing - Daniel / Kazim
TODO-12 Profile and About - Tony
