# Unfinished Stories / Tasks

Nothing!

# Demo Feedback

The client gave us a couple of suggestions:

1. Hide usernames when rating debates
2. Minimum characters in debate analysis
3. See all debate questions (even ones you don't rate) after evaluation
4. Have trivia be less surprising by giving the user a confirmation button before starting
5. Solo trivia should have unlimited play
6. Colour palette should be less bland

# Practices We Should / Shouldn't Continue and New Practices

Sometimes instead of rebasing, we end up pulling changes in from master and this causes inconsistencies in our git timeline.
We should instead discontinue this practice and enforce that people stick with rebasing to keep our git flow consistent.

We should continue our weekly Saturday meetings because it gave us a chance to catch up with each other's progress and bring up concerns. It also helped our own timelines to make sure we weren't blocking others.

Last sprint we implemented the one-approval requirement and we should continue this practice as it allowed us to get code in quicker while still maintaining a reasonable quality of code.

# Best / Worst Experience in Sprint 3

The worst experience was fixing inconsistencies in our git timeline. Features this sprint were also started later than usual and caused some crunch.

The best experience was having the ability to be creative because we were more well-versed with React + Redux. We could dedicate more time to presentation.
