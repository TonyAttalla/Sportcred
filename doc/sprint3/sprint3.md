## Meeting Topics / Prioritization

We are surprisingly running low on stories because we ended up being very ambitious in Sprint 2.
We will prioritize the one story we didn't end up completing from Sprint 2 and grab the biggest features from our backlog for Sprint 3.

## Sprint Goal

Including the user stories below, we also want to clean up our code and squash bugs.
We will complete the following user stories and meet their respective criterion of satisfaction.

**TODO-21 Playoff Bracket Predictions**

- As a user I want to be able to make playoff brackets in order to raise my ACS score

1. Given that I am a user when I enter the picks and predictions area of the application then I should be able to make playoff brackets before the beginning of the playoff period
2. Given that I have made my playoff bracket when I enter the app then I should be rewarded or decremented points from my ACS based on how close my bracket was to what had happened in the playoff

**TODO-18 Trivia**

- As a user I want to be able to play solo trivia games so I can test my skills and improve my score.

1. Given that the user has already played 5 times in the same day, when they try to play again, they will be prevented
2. Given that a user has already answered a trivia question, when they enter trivia quiz, they will not be recommended the same questions until all trivia questions available are asked
3. Given that a user is trying to answer a question, when they take too long to answer it, the question will be marked as blank and they will be forwarded to the next question
4. Given that the user is playing trivia, when the user just starts or just finished answering a question, then the user should be presented with a trivia question and multiple choice options.
5. Given that the user is playing trivia, when the user answers a question correctly, then they should gain ACS points.
6. Given that the user is playing trivia, when the user answers a question incorrectly, then they should lose ACS points.

**TODO-24 Topics of Conversation in Debate**

- As a user, I should be able to reply to debate topics so that I can have submit my analysis on that topic

1. Given that I’m a user and I navigate to the debate page, when I enter the page, then I should be able to see a list of debate topics
2. Given that I’m on the debate page, when I choose a topic, I should be able to write my analysis and see it visible after I submit it

**TODO-26 ACS Score Tiers in Debate**

- As a user, my analysis should only be visible to users within my tier to make sure that I’m debating with fans within my level of expertise

1. Given that I’m in a particular tier, when I enter the debate page, then I should only see analyses from other users in my tier

**TODO-25 Debate Analysis Rating**

- As a user, I should be able to rate other users’ analyses on debate topics based on a scale of 0-100% agreeance

1. Given that I’m a user, when the debate topic response window is over, then I should be presented with 2-3 other analyses of the topic
2. Given that I’m a user, when I'm presented with other users' analyses of the topic, I should be able to rate them on a scale of 0-100%

## Spikes

The design and styling of playoff brackets might be difficult and is quite difficult to estimate the amount of time needed.

## Team Capacity

As 7 team members, we are taking on a total of 5 user stories that have a total of 23 story points = 23 ideal days worth of work.
That's about 3.2 ideal days worth of work per person. Our last sprint had 26 story points and we barely finished so we decided to aim slightly lower. With another 2 weeks of experience and a lower goal, this seems reasonable (also no midterms).

User stories are split up as follows:

TODO-21 Playoff Bracket Predictions - Siavash / Roozbeh (5)

TODO-18 Trivia - Tony / Kazim / Daniel (7)

TODO-24 Topics of Conversation in Debate - Sendooran / Antony / Kazim / Daniel (4)

TODO-26 ACS Score Tiers in Debate - Sendooran / Antony / Kazim / Daniel (3)

TODO-25 Debate Analysis Rating - Sendooran / Antony / Kazim / Daniel (4)
