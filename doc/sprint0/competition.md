## **Competition**

## reddit.com/r/nba

r/nba is a completely user driven forum that allows users to create posts, and comment on other users posts. Users can "upvote" and "downvote" comments or posts. The most upvoted posts are floated to the top of the subreddit and the most upvoted comments are floated to the top of the comment sections for their respective posts. The more a user is upvoted, the higher their "Karma score"

**Similarities :**

 - Focused on user discussion
 - Has an agree/disagree system where users can essentially "vote" on other users' comments
 - Reddit has integration with other social media platforms (Users can comment and upvote on links to tweets, for instance)
 
 **Differences:**
 - Reddit lacks a picks/predictions system.
 - While Karma exists, it has no effect on who a user gets to talk with.
 - Reddit posts are user-generated, not provided by admins.
 - Reddit Karma isn't meant to be shown off in real life (While ACS score is)
 - Reddit Karma is sitewide, and isn't specific to sports, while ACS score is exclusively for this purpose
 
 The subreddit is focused on basketball news and discussion as a whole, but doesn't really focus on allowing a user to "prove themselves". SPORTCRED is better for users who want to show off their knowledge of the sport and their ability to predict results/statistics. This is because of the prominence of the ACS score, which can be accumulated and shown off as an achievement. In summary, r/nba is much more focused on the user discussion aspect and much less on the idea of developing credibility through the site.

## Fantasy Sports sites (nba.com/fantasy , https://www.fanduel.com/)

Fantasy sites allow users to get with a group of freinds, create their own rosters, and compete against each other for points. Most fantasy sites allow users to make daily and season-long picks. Most sites are centered around gambling, where users have to make bets in order to make predictions. (Presumably, this is how the sites are monetized).

**Similarities :**

 - Focused on making picks and predictions
 - Allows users to compete against each other
 - Allows users to make dailiy and once-per-season predictions 
 
**Differences:**
 - Fantasy sites usually have an age minimum
 - No ability for users to discuss and debate their opinions on topics
 - No integration with other social media platforms
 - SPORTCRED doesn't have any financial integration

The primary purpose of fantasy sports sites is to allow users to demonstrate their knowledge and win money within their small group of freinds, and doesn't have a ranking system that allows users to communicate with people at their own level of knowledge and skill. Because of this, fantasy sites put you in a bubble with your own group of freinds and if you wish to discuss something with them, it must be done off the platform. The fundamental difference is that fantasy sites focus on competition, not discussion. Because of this, SPORTCRED is better suited for users who would prefer to debate with others and build up a reputation, rather than just win money.
