# User Principles:
- Fruitful discussions over gamification
	- We don't want people to be able to abuse the ACS systems but rather we want to use ACS to encourage fruitful discussion instead

- Learning should be fun and engaging
	- Learning about sports shouldn’t feel like a chore, users should want to go into the Trivia section to try and increase their ACS score because it’s fun to do so.

- Fair treatment of all users over ACS scores
	- The user should be able to engage in all the parts of the app regardless of their ACS score, and in case of their score getting close to the minimum, they should be able to get help so they maintain their interest.

- Active collaboration and diversity of data without polarization
	- When our application is based on opinions, we don’t want to segregate our user base in terms of their values (i.e. we want them to see conflicting opinions)
