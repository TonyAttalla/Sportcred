# Getting to know each other
Our team consists of 7 members and the main way we communicate is through Discord.

Before sprint0, we had already gauged the strengths and weaknesses of each person through a virtual meeting. This meeting was to get to know each other and figure out what everyone was comfortable with.

# Making Decisions
When it comes to making decisions, there's is no structured way that we follow. Suggestions are brought up by anyone and as long as everyone agrees, we can come to a decision that is reasonable and everyone is comfortable with. There is not an appointed "leader" of the group.

# Daily Standup
We decided to make a text channel for daily standups with a simple template of

```
What I worked on yesterday:
1.
2.
3.

What I will work on today:
1.
2.
3.

What I'm currently blocked by:
1.
2.
3.
```

We will report in this channel every day, even if there is no progress made that day.
This is to keep us updated on what everyone is working on and the progress of their work. It also helps us keep each other accountable and enables us to help each other if there are blockers that need to be resolved.

# Weekly Meetings
Besides daily standup, we also meet every Saturday at 2PM (non-mandatory, but highly encouraged) so we can talk about anything that we're working on, demo certain parts of our work, or raise concerns that can be addressed by the rest of the group.

# Conventions Established
We decided on a branch naming convention of TICKET-1000/SHORT-SUMMARY and we will merge branches directly into master.

# User Stories
We wrote our user stories individually for each feature at first. Then as a group, we were able to go over each other's user stories and give constructive crticism. Priorities are first assigned by each person writing their own user story and when going over each of the user stories as a group, if anyone has any objections or a differing opinion, it would be brought up for discussion.

Story points were done as a group and we played story point poker verbally. We would all say how long a story would take and if there were differing opinions, it would be brought up for discussion. Usually after 3 rounds we could decide. 

A struggle we had was the varying levels of experience on the team with the specific tech stack we chose (MERN). Many have not used react before and it would be hard to estimate how long each feature would take especially with a big learning curve in the beginning of the project.

# Lessons
We learned that this system was doing pretty well so far. The point of agile is to adjust to changing requirements and oversight so we realized nothing is set in stone and we should make the best we could for a sprint with the information that we currently had.

We also learned to organize our discord channel into more specific groups to stay organized on topics and be able to find important shared resources.
