### How we estimate
Priority of a user story is determined on a scale out of 5. 5/5 is the highest priority and 1/5 is the lowest.
After an initial priority is provided by the team member creathing the user story, the group discusses the assignment and comes to an agreement on the apprioriate priority for the user story.

Story points are done using days. This gives us a concrete goal to complete stories.
Story points are decided as a team after the user story is written. Similar to how priorities are determine, the group will come to an agreement on the appropriate number of days a user story may take.
